 Getting started
=================

This section of the manual contains introductory tutorials to e.g. run your
first test or setup the distributed infrastructure.

Running your first test
=======================

Start by installing labgrid, either by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install labgrid

or by cloning the repository and installing manually:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/labgrid-project/labgrid
    $ cd labgrid && python3 setup.py install


test your installation by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ labgrid-client --help
    usage: labgrid-client [-h] [-x URL] [-c CONFIG] [-p PLACE] [-d] COMMAND ...

    ...

if the help for labgrid-client does not show up, open an `Issue
<https://github.com/labgrid-project/labgrid/issues>`_. If everything was
successful so far, start by copying the initial example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir ../first_test/
    $ cp examples/shell/* ../first_test/ 
    $ cd ../first_test/

connect your embedded board (raspberry pi, riotboard, â€¦) to your computer and
adjust the ``port`` parameter of the ``RawSerialPort`` resource in
``local.yaml``, adjusting it to the port your board is connected to. You can
check which port gets assigned to your USB-Serial converter by unplugging the
converter, running ``dmesg -w`` and plugging it back in. Finally run your first
test: 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pytest --env-config=local.yaml test_shell.py
